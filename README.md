## Greedy and Dynamic Programming Algorithms

This project contains implementations of classical optimization problems
developed for an Algorithms course at the State University of Maringá (UEM).

The focus is on applying algorithm design techniques and analyzing their correctness
and complexity.

### Implemented Problems

#### Task Scheduling (Greedy Algorithm)
- Selects tasks to minimize total lost value
- Uses a greedy strategy combined with Union-Find
- Time complexity: O(N log N)

#### Domino Effect (Dynamic Programming)
- Determines the minimum number of domino pieces to move
- Bottom-up dynamic programming approach
- Time complexity: O(N²)

### Concepts Covered
- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Union-Find with path compression
- Time complexity analysis
